# Project: Calculator

An online calculator with basic arithmetic operations built using HTML/CSS/JS. Live version of the game is __[here](https://cigmaian.github.io/Calculator/)__.

## Features

- All basic operations are supported (divide, multiple, remainder, add, subtract).
- Keyboard inputs are supported for numbers, opertaors and other options.
- Comes with options to clear/delete a single input OR clear the whole display.

## Journey 

I had to re-factor my work several times as I realized how different functions and variables interacted with each other. I hope to learn more on how to plan and execute a project like this more efficiently.
